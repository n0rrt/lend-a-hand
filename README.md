regular user (user) logs in to the site. There are 3 options, find a hand, find a professional, lend a hand.
find a hand connects the user to one or more other users, depending on how many users are available and meet certain criteria. They are all put into a secure chat room, with logs only being kept for moderation purposes. Find a professional pings certified users with areas of expertise in line with the user's need.These certified users can then either connect with them immediately, or set up a time to meet with them. certified users will have a mailbox of sorts to organize their incoming requests. Lend a hand does the same as find a hand, but with different weight. The system will flag them as "looking to help" rather than seeking help and will connect accordingly.
